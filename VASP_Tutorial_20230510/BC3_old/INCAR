## Project name
SYSTEM = BC3 Practice

## Start parameters for this Run
ISTART = 0
ICHARG = 2

## Electronic optimization (Low, Medium, High, Accurate)
PREC = Low
# Defaults from POTCAR
ENCUT = 400
# Alorithm for electron optimization, can be also FAST or ALL
ALGO  =  Normal
# of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small
NELM = 200
# Stopping-criterion for ELM
EDIFF = 1E-3
# Stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2)
EDIFFG = -1E-3
# Broadening and DOS related values
SIGMA = 0.1
ISMEAR = 0
# Stress tensor
ISIF = 3

## Ionic relaxation
# Number of steps for IOM   
NSW = 40
# CG for ions, often 1 (RMM-DISS) is faster    
IBRION = 2
# Step for ionic-motion (for MD in fs)
# POTIM = .1

# Performance optimization
# The number of groups made, each group working on one set of k-points 
KPAR = 1
# How many cores handling one orbital
NCORE = 4
# Real space projection; slightly less accurate but faster 
#LREAL = Auto
