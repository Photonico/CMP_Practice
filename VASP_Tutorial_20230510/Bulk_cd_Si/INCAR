# Created by Lu Niu, LukeNiu@outlook.com, Apr 19, 2023

## Project name
SYSTEM = cd Si
# Free energy for different lattice parameters; Fit to some equation of states to obtain the equilibrium volume.
# Perform a static (NSW=0, IBRION=-1) self consistent calculation for the DOS (the DOS is found in the DOSCAR file.
# For large system, converge with a small number of k points, and ncrease the number of k points for the DOS and set ICHARG=11 (charge density from the last self-consistent run). ICHARG=11 treats each k point independently and keeps the charge density and the potential fixed.
# Read CHGCAR from previous run. To copy the self-consistent charge density of example fcc_Si to your current working directory. You must do this otherwise VASP can not read the CHGCAR and will terminate.
# The smearing of the k points is set to the tetrahedron method with Bl√∂chl corrections (ISMEAR=-5 to fi the problem

## Start parameters for this Run
ISTART = 0
ICHARG = 2

## Electronic optimization (Low, Medium, High, Accurate)
PREC = Accurate
# Defaults from POTCAR
ENCUT = 240
# Alorithm for electron optimization, can be also FAST or ALL
# ALGO  =  Normal
# of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small
# NELM = 200
# Stopping-criterion for ELM
EDIFF = 1E-6
# Stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2)
EDIFFG = -1E-6
# Broadening and DOS related values
SIGMA = 0.1
ISMEAR = 0
# Stress tensor
# ISIF = 3

## Ionic relaxation
# Number of steps for IOM   
# NSW = 40
# CG for ions, often 1 (RMM-DISS) is faster    
# IBRION = 2
# Step for ionic-motion (for MD in fs)
# POTIM = .1

# Performance optimization
# The number of groups made, each group working on one set of k-points 
# KPAR = 1
# How many cores handling one orbital
# NCORE = 4
# Real space projection; slightly less accurate but faster 
# LREAL = Auto
