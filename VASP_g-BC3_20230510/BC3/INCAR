## Project name
SYSTEM = BC3

## Start parameters for this Run
ISTART = 0
ICHARG = 2

## Electronic optimization (Low, Medium, High, Accurate)
PREC = Accurate
# Projected Density of States and Mulliken population analysis
# LORBIT = 11
# Defaults from POTCAR
ENCUT = 450

# Alorithm for electron optimization, can be also FAST or ALL
# ALGO  =  Normal
# of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small
# NELM = 200
# Stopping-criterion for ELM
EDIFF = 1E-6
# Stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2)
EDIFFG = -1E-6
# Broadening and DOS related values
SIGMA = 0.2
ISMEAR = 0
# Stress tensor
# ISIF = 3
# Electron Spin
# ISPIN = 2
# Magnetic moment
# MAGMON = 1

## Ionic relaxation
# Number of steps for IOM   
# NSW = 40
# CG for ions, often 1 (RMM-DISS) is faster    
# IBRION = 2
# Step for ionic-motion (for MD in fs)
# POTIM = .1

# Performance optimization
# The number of groups made, each group working on one set of k-points 
# KPAR = 1
# How many cores handling one orbital
# NCORE = 4
# Real space projection; slightly less accurate but faster 
# LREAL = Auto
