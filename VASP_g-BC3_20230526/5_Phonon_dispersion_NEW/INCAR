#### Calculation Information for BC3
# Created by Lu Niu, LukeNiu@outlook.com, May 18, 2023

## Project name
SYSTEM = BC3

## Start parameters for this Run (default ICHARG = 2 when ISTART = 0; ICHARG = 11 for bandstructure and DOS calculation)
ISTART = 0              # Start job from scratch
ICHARG = 2              # Use initial wavefunctions provided in WAVECAR
#LCHARG = .TRUE.         # LCHARG = .TRUE. for generating CHGCAR

## Electronic optimization (Low, Medium, High, Accurate)
PREC = Accurate
# Projected Density of States and Mulliken population analysis
# LORBIT = 11
# Defaults from POTCAR
ENCUT = 450             # Taken from "Strain-tunable electronic..." RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 1686

# Alorithm for electron optimization, can be also FAST or ALL
ALGO = Normal
# of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small
NELM = 200
# Stopping-criterion for ELM
EDIFF = 1E-6
# Stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2)
EDIFFG = -1E-3
# Broadening and DOS related values (ISMEAR = -5 for tetrahedral method for DOS)
SIGMA = 0.1                # A small value of smearing is used
ISMEAR = 0 # Gaussian Smearing
# Stress tensor
ISIF = 2                    # Specifies that stress tensor should be calculated, ISIF = 2 only atomic positions optimised (default), ISIF = 3 atomic positions and supercell geometry are optimised.
# Electron Spin
# ISPIN = 2
# Magnetic moment
# MAGMON = 1

## Ionic relaxation
# Number of steps for IOM   
NSW = 1
# CG for ions, often 1 (RMM-DISS) is faster (IBRION = -1 for time-independent)
IBRION = 8                  # Switches to use perturbation theory method, suitable for phonon calculations
# Step for ionic-motion (for MD in fs)
# POTIM = 0.01

# Performance optimization
# The number of groups made, each group working on one set of k-points 
# KPAR = 1
# How many cores handling one orbital
# NCORE = 4
# Real space projection; slightly less accurate but faster 
# LREAL = Auto
